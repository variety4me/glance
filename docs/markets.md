#### Properties

| Name | Type | Required |
| ---- | ---- | -------- |
| markets | array | yes |
| sort-by | string | no |
| chart-link-template | string | no |

##### `markets`
An array of markets for which to display information about.

##### `sort-by`
By default the markets are displayed in the order they were defined. You can customize their ordering by setting the `sort-by` property to `change` for descending order based on the stock's percentage change (e.g. 1% would be sorted higher than -1%) or `absolute-change` for descending order based on the stock's absolute price change (e.g. -1% would be sorted higher than +0.5%).

##### `chart-link-template`
A template for the link to go to when clicking on the chart that will be applied to all markets. The value `{SYMBOL}` will be replaced with the symbol of the market. You can override this on a per-market basis by specifying a `chart-link` property. Example:

```yaml
chart-link-template: https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol={SYMBOL}
```

##### `symbol-link-template`
A template for the link to go to when clicking on the symbol that will be applied to all markets. The value `{SYMBOL}` will be replaced with the symbol of the market. You can override this on a per-market basis by specifying a `symbol-link` property. Example:

```yaml
