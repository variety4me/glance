### Server Stats
Display statistics such as CPU usage, memory usage and disk usage of the server Glance is running on or other servers.

Example:

```yaml
- type: server-stats
  servers:
    - type: local
      name: Services
```

To display data from a remote server you need to have the Glance Agent running on that server. You can download the agent from [here](https://github.com/glanceapp/agent), though keep in mind that it is still in development and may not work as expected. Support for other providers such as Glances will be added in the future.

In the event that the CPU temperature goes over 80Â°C, a flame icon will appear next to the CPU. The progress indicators will also turn red (or the equivalent of your negative color) to hopefully grab your attention if anything is unusually high:

#### Properties
| Name | Type | Required | Default |
| ---- | ---- | -------- | ------- |
| servers | array | no |  |

##### `servers`
If not provided it will display the statistics of the server Glance is running on.

##### Properties for both `local` and `remote` servers
| Name | Type | Required | Default |
| ---- | ---- | -------- | ------- |
| type | string | yes |  |
| name | string | no |  |
| hide-swap | boolean | no | false |

###### `type`
Whether to display statistics for the local server or a remote server. Possible values are `local` and `remote`.

###### `name`
The name of the server which will be displayed on the widget. If not provided it will default to the server's hostname.

###### `hide-swap`
Whether to hide the swap usage.

##### Properties for the `local` server
| Name | Type | Required | Default |
| ---- | ---- | -------- | ------- |
| cpu-temp-sensor | string | no |  |
| hide-mountpoints-by-default | boolean | no | false |
| mountpoints | map\[string\]object | no |  |

###### `cpu-temp-sensor`
The name of the sensor to use for the CPU temperature. When not provided the widget will attempt to find the correct one, if it fails to do so the temperature will not be displayed. To view the available sensors you can use `sensors` command.

###### `hide-mountpoints-by-default`
If set to `true` you'll have to manually make each mountpoint visible by adding a `hide: false` property to it like so:

```yaml
- type: server-stats
  servers:
    - type: local
      hide-mountpoints-by-default: true
      mountpoints:
        "/":
          hide: false
        "/mnt/data":
          hide: false
```

This is useful if you're running Glance inside of a container which usually mounts a lot of irrelevant filesystems.

###### `mountpoints`
A map of mountpoints to display disk usage for. The key is the path to the mountpoint and the value is an object with optional properties. Example:

```yaml
mountpoints:
  "/":
    name: Root
  "/mnt/data":
    name: Data
  "/boot/efi":
    hide: true
```

##### Properties for each `mountpoint`
| Name | Type | Required | Default |
| ---- | ---- | -------- | ------- |
| name | string | no |  |
| hide | boolean | no | false |

###### `name`
The name of the mountpoint which will be displayed on the widget. If not provided it will default to the mountpoint's path.

###### `hide`
Whether to hide this mountpoint from the widget.

##### Properties for `remote` servers
| Name | Type | Required | Default |
| ---- | ---- | -------- | ------- |
| url | string | yes |  |
| token | string | no |  |
| timeout | string | no | 3s |

###### `url`
The URL and port of the server to fetch the statistics from.

###### `token`
The authentication token to use when fetching the statistics.

###### `timeout`
The maximum time to wait for a response from the server. The value is a string and must be a number followed by one of s, m, h, d. Example: `10s` for 10 seconds, `1m` for 1 minute, etc
